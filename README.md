# Sensing-soil-moisture-content-by-auto-irrigation-system
Problem Statement/Opportunity*:
The main objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system that solves most problems related to irrigation & agriculture such as increasing agricultural production, minimize manual intervention, preserving plants from pests.

Project Description*:
An analysis of soil moisture readings is a good way to determine when and how much to irrigate no matter irrigation method.Soil moisture monitoring provides detailed information about the soil moisture status, to know which crop should irrigate in that field.Irrigation scheduling through soil moisture analysis improves efficiency and can lead to improved quality, yield and profits. Soil moisture measurement makes it easier to manage many irrigation issues. To be effective, sensors must be placed in that field that will accurately represent how the field or area is weighted by the system. By using the soil moisture values through sensors we will classify that which crop should irrigate in that field by using machine learning algorithms.
